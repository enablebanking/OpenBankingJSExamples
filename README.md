# OpenBankingJSExamples

Sample JavaScript code showing how to use Open banking APIs (PSD2 AISP &amp; PISP) using [enable:Banking JS library](https://enablebanking.com/docs/sdk?javascript).

This repository contains 2 independent code samples:

- [aispdemo](/aispdemo) - retrieving account information (list of accounts, accounts' balances and transactions) using existing consent ID
- [pispdemo](/pispdemo) - authenticating user and getting account information consent, retrieving list of account and transferring money from one account to the other own account (payment confirmation is done using bank's web UI)
